<p class="distill-post-title">European Student Assembly 2025 (ESA25)</p>

The past few days at the European Parliament in Strasbourg have been nothing short of transformative for me! 🇪🇺
I’m incredibly honoured to have represented the Universitatea din București and CIVIS - Europe's Civic University Alliance at the European Student Assembly 2025 (ESA25). Out of over 2,330 applications, 240 delegates from 50 nationalities were selected to help shape the future of Europe 🌍 
Since February this year, my fellow delegates and I have been working collaboratively to draft policy recommendations addressing some of the most pressing challenges facing the European Union. 
As a passionate advocate for education and lifelong learning, I joined Panel 5: Education Beyond Graduation, where we focused on advancing educational equity, accessibility, and innovation to ensure lifelong learning opportunities for all 🌱 We tackled critical themes such as bridging regional disparities in educational infrastructure, ensuring alumni access to continuing education, integrating AI for upskilling, and fostering inclusive and accessible learning environments 🎓 
 I’m deeply grateful to have worked alongside brilliant minds from across Europe, united by purpose, passion, and a shared vision for a more inclusive and educated future!
Throughout this journey, I’ve learned:
👉 Democracy thrives when every voice is heard.
👉 International collaboration drives meaningful, innovative change.
👉 Inclusivity is essential to shaping impactful policy.
👉 Youth voices are powerful drivers in policymaking.
👉 Diversity strengthens the feasibility and depth of solutions.
Our work culminated in a plenary session at the European Parliament, where we voted on 76 policy proposals. I'm proud to share that the recommendation my subgroup co-authored on advancing accessible, intergenerational lifelong learning infrastructure, was adopted with 150 'yes' votes 🎉
What’s next? The dissemination phase, during which our recommendations will be presented to key EU stakeholders, including the European Commission 🏛️🇪🇺 
A heartfelt thank you to my fellow Panel 5 delegates and to EUC Voices for providing a platform where student voices truly matter!
